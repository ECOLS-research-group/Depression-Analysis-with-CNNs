# Depression-Analysis-with-CNNs
This repository contains Python implementations of 1D and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) designed for analyzing depression from text data. The project explores various image transformation techniques, including histograms, heatmaps, and bar graphs, to visualize and interpret the results of the CNN models.
